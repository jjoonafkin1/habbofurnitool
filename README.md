# Habbo Multi-tool
Welcome to the Habbo Hotel: Origins Multi-tool repository! This tool is designed to improve the management of items in the cumbersome Habbo Hotel hand interface.

This is the second version release and while minimally tested it offers basic functionality to ease item management. Note that this is my first project with AutoHotkey and the code may not be the prettiest, as I am a self-taught semi nerd.

* The script might not handle all edge cases or work flawlessly in every scenario.
* Feedback and contributions are welcome to improve the functionality and reliability of the tool.

## Troubleshooting
* In it's current state the tool works best with item specific rooms using the small client.
* If the script does not find the Habbo Hotel client, ensure it is running.

 **Note!** If you have several clients open simultaneously, make sure you click on your main client to activate it, after which you can select the desired action from the tool.
