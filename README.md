# Habbo Furni tool
Welcome to the Habbo Hotel: Origins furni tool repository!
This tool is designed to help improve the management of items in the notoriously cumbersome Habbo Hotel hand interface.
This is the first version release, and while it has been minimally tested, it offers basic functionality to make item management easier.

## Features
* Placing Items from Hand to Room: Automates the process of selecting furni from your hand and placing them directly into your room.
* Picking Up Items from Room to Hand: Automates picking up items from your room back to your hand.
* Placing Items from Hand to Trade Window: Automates the action of transferring items from your hand to the trade window.

## Notes
* This is the first version release and has undergone minimal testing. Use at your own risk.
* The script might not handle all edge cases or work flawlessly in every scenario.
* Feedback and contributions are welcome to improve the functionality and reliability of the tool.

## Troubleshooting
* In it's current state the tool works best with item specific rooms using the small client.
* If the script does not find the Habbo Hotel client, ensure it is running and visible on your screen.

 **Note!** If you have several clients open simultaneously, make sure you click on your main client to activate it, after which you can select the desired action from the tool.

## License
While this project is open source and licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/jjoonafkin1/habbofurnitool/blob/main/LICENSE), I sincerely ask that you leave the development to me. This will allow me to improve my self-taught programming skills and maintain a consistent development vision. Your understanding and support are greatly appreciated as I strive to become a better programmer. Contributions in the form of issues or suggestions are always welcome.

## Acknowledgments
* Thanks to the AutoHotkey community for providing a great scripting language and helpful resources.

I hope this tool makes your Habbo Hotel experience more enjoyable. Happy roleplaying and trading!
