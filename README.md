# Habbo Furni tool
Welcome to the Habbo Hotel: Origins Furni Tool repository! This tool is designed to improve the management of items in the cumbersome Habbo Hotel hand interface.

This is the first version release and, while minimally tested, it offers basic functionality to ease item management. Note that this is my first project with AutoHotkey and the code may not be the prettiest, as I am a self-taught semi nerd.


## Features
* **Placing Items from Hand to Room**: Automates selecting furni from your hand and placing it directly into your room.
* **Picking Up Items from Room to Hand**: Automates picking up items from your room back to your hand.
* **Placing Items from Hand to Trade Window**: Automates transferring items from your hand to the trade window.

## Usage
* **Option 1**: Download the ready-converted script to EXE [here](https://github.com/jjoonafkin1/habbofurnitool/releases/download/v1.0.0/Habbo.Furni.Tool.exe).
* **Option 2.** Download the source code as zip, extract to a folder and run **habbo.ahk**

## Notes
* This is the first version release and has undergone minimal testing. Use at your own risk.
* The script might not handle all edge cases or work flawlessly in every scenario.
* Feedback and contributions are welcome to improve the functionality and reliability of the tool.

## Troubleshooting
* In it's current state the tool works best with item specific rooms using the small client.
* If the script does not find the Habbo Hotel client, ensure it is running and visible on your screen.

 **Note!** If you have several clients open simultaneously, make sure you click on your main client to activate it, after which you can select the desired action from the tool.
